It is possible that one material can have multiple ores, this can however create unnecessary bloat when not done correctly, so in order to try to prevent that I will try for each ore to meet some requirements to be added:
* Be unique for that material in either composition or material density
* Have multiple other uses other than obtaining the material, especially as purity is decreased, atleast one "common" use
	* One of the common uses would be as a dye (For example Malachine having green pigment, therefore being good for green dye)
	* Another common use can be as a decoration, that depends on the nature on material itself, as gems will naturally be more fit for decoration
	* Gems can also be used for things that have to do with lasers or light in general, such as infusing glass with it or routing lasers
	* Alot of materials can be used in crafting recipe, however it should make sense and things should not be gatekeeped behind an uncommon material
* The ore should be atleast based in reality, altho it is hard to represent the difference between metallic and crystallic structure, it can atleast be attempted with the drops and or processing results
* Ores (atleast common ones) should be refinable even at relatively early stages of the game, even at a cost of less efficient processing, as to not cause a situation where a player is just storing 7 stacks of some ore because "one day" they will be able to refine it.
	* An example here being Chalcopyrite which consists of mainly Copper, Iron and Sulfur, with a crude operation Copper could be extracted, however with more advanced processing the Iron and Sulfur components could be extracted too
	* Another example is Monazite, which in real life contains Thorium, but it is mostly discarded as the ore is mined for its Rare Earth Elements
